Welcome to my first game created in Unity! Inspired by a tutorial on YouTube, I embarked on this journey to delve into game development. This project, aptly named "Flappy Bird Tutorial," marks my initial foray into the realm of game design.

To experience the game, simply download the zip file, extract its contents, and launch the 'FlappyBirdTutorial.exe' executable. Please note that as a novice game developer, I didn't implement a conventional exit feature. To quit the game, you may need to use the Alt+F4 shortcut.

While simplistic in nature, this creation holds sentimental value as it represents my humble beginnings in game development. I hope you find enjoyment in playing this basic yet entertaining game.

If you're curious about the tutorial that guided me through this process and helped me grasp the fundamental concepts of Unity, you can find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM&t=2s). Let's continue learning and creating together!
